Feel free to use or rip-out any of its parts.


## Prerequisites

1. PostgreSQL

2. Go programming language, version 1.3.x or newer.

## Installation

1. export PGPASSWORD=<pgpassword for current user>

2. `go get github.com/go-bootstrap/go-bootstrap`

3. `$GOPATH/bin/go-bootstrap -dir github.com/{git-user}/{project-name}`

4. Start using it: `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/{git-user}/{project-name} && go run main.go`


## PostgreSQL Environment Variables

If you have `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGSSLMODE` environment variables set,
they will be used to generate and bootstrap the database.
